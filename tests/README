This folder is for tests of different kinds, both unit test (if possible and
reasonable) and integration tests.

Please order the tests with a folder for each of the categories (common,
drivers, parsers etc.) and a file inside for each class.

The tests are made to be run with pytest, which will automatically pick up
tests from files and functions that start with 'test'. To execute the test,
enter e.g. the common folder and do:
    python -m pytest
to run all tests in there, or
    python -m pytest test_continous_logger.py
to run only the tests of the continous logger.

More information about pytest can be read on the homepage:
