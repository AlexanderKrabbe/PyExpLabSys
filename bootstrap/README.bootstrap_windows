The bootstrap script expects:

 * That Python 2.7 and all the extra packages that PyExpLabSys requires has been installed. This is most easily accomplished with Python(x, y), see below.
 * That Git for Windows has already been installed. Get the installer from: http://git-scm.com/
 * That the PyExpLabSys git archive has been cloned into C:\git\PyExpLabSys

No parts of the script will cause problems if run more than once.


About Python(x, y)
==================

Python(x, y) is Python for scientific environments. It is a collection of packages that includes almost all of the packages that PyExpLabSys depend on and it is therefore by far the easiest way to get set up in a hurry.

Download Python(x, y) from this page: https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/wiki/Downloads

When installing Python(x, y), leave all the default packages selected and make sure that the following extra packages are also selected:

 * pip
 * pyserial
 * minimalmodbus
 * pyodbc
