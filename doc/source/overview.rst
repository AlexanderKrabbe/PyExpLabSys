Module Overview
***************

The table in section :ref:`module_overview` contains an overview of all the modules in
PyExpLabSys. The overview consist of a short description (the first line of the module
docstring) and its Python 2/3 support status.

PyExpLabSys strive to support Python version 2.7 and >=3.3. See the section
:ref:`py3_support` about Python 3 support.

Python 3 support
================

**We love Python 3**. Unfortunately we are not hired to make software, but to keep a lab
running. This means that modules are only ported to Python 3, when it is either convinient or
we are touching the code anyway.

.. [#inferred] For these modules the Python 2/3 status is not
	       indicated directly in the source code file and so the
	       status is inferred.
